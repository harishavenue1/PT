LoadRunner Study Guide
Glossary of Key Terms:
LoadRunner: A performance testing tool developed by Micro Focus. It simulates user activity on an application to measure its performance under different load conditions.
Performance Testing: A type of software testing that evaluates an application's speed, responsiveness, stability, and scalability under a given workload.
Virtual User (Vuser): A simulated user in LoadRunner that mimics real user behavior by sending requests to the application under test.
Scenario: A defined set of actions that virtual users perform during a LoadRunner test. It includes the number of users, their behavior, and the duration of the test.
Load Generator: A machine running LoadRunner software responsible for generating and executing virtual user scripts, simulating user activity on the application.
Controller: The central component of LoadRunner that manages and controls the entire performance test. It allows you to configure the scenario, launch virtual users, monitor the system, collect data, and generate reports.
VUGen (Virtual User Generator): The component of LoadRunner used to create and edit virtual user scripts that simulate user actions on the application under test.
Protocol: A set of rules and standards that governs the communication between the client (virtual user) and the server (application under test). LoadRunner supports a wide range of protocols.
Transaction: A logical unit of work in a LoadRunner script, representing a specific user action or a sequence of actions. It helps measure the response time and performance of critical parts of the application.
Rendezvous Point: A point in a LoadRunner script where virtual users synchronize their actions, ensuring they perform a specific action simultaneously to simulate peak loads.
SLA (Service Level Agreement): A set of performance goals or thresholds defined for the application under test. LoadRunner can measure and report on the application's compliance with these SLAs.
Correlation: The process of identifying and extracting dynamic values from the server responses and using them in subsequent requests to maintain the session and ensure accurate test execution.
Analysis: The component of LoadRunner that analyzes the performance test results and presents them in various reports and graphs, allowing users to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.

Quiz Answer Key:
LoadRunner is a performance testing tool used to simulate user activity on an application and measure its performance under various load conditions. It helps identify bottlenecks and ensure the application can handle expected user loads.
The Controller is the central component that manages the entire performance test, including configuring the scenario, launching virtual users, monitoring the system, and collecting data. VUGen, on the other hand, is the component used to create and edit the scripts that define the actions virtual users will perform during the test.
A virtual user is a simulated user in LoadRunner that mimics the behavior of a real user interacting with the application. It sends requests to the application, helping testers understand how the application behaves under different user loads.
The three default actions are: vuser_init, Action, and vuser_end. vuser_init is executed once at the beginning of the test, usually for initialization tasks like launching the application or logging in. Action contains the main business logic of the script and is iterated multiple times as needed. vuser_end is executed once at the end of the test, typically for cleanup tasks like logging out or closing the application.
Transactions in VUGen scripts define logical units of work, representing specific user actions or a sequence of actions. They are crucial because they allow testers to measure the response time and performance of critical parts of the application separately, making it easier to pinpoint bottlenecks and performance issues. Transactions are defined using the lr_start_transaction and lr_end_transaction functions in the script.
A rendezvous point in a LoadRunner scenario is a synchronization point where virtual users pause their individual execution and wait for all other users to arrive. This ensures that all users perform a specific action at the same time, simulating a sudden surge of user activity and testing how the application handles peak loads.
Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are predefined performance goals or thresholds set for the application under test. These goals may include metrics like response time, throughput, or error rates. LoadRunner can measure the application's performance against these SLAs and report on whether the application met the defined expectations.
Manual scenarios allow the tester to explicitly define all aspects of the test, including the number of users, their behavior over time, and the test duration. Goal-oriented scenarios, however, focus on achieving a specific performance goal. The tester defines the desired goal, and LoadRunner automatically adjusts the load and other parameters to try and reach that goal.
The 'Solution Explorer' tab in VUGen provides a hierarchical view of the entire script, including all actions, parameters, runtime settings, data files, and reports associated with the script. The 'Step Navigator' tab, on the other hand, lists all the functions used in the script, allowing users to quickly navigate to specific parts of the script by double-clicking on the function name.
Granularity in LoadRunner Analysis refers to the time interval used to display data points on a graph. A finer granularity uses smaller time intervals, resulting in a more detailed graph showing more frequent data points. Coarser granularity uses larger time intervals, resulting in a less detailed graph with fewer data points. Granularity allows testers to control the level of detail they see in the performance data and can help identify trends and patterns more easily.
